# Memory Management

Maintain persistent context across sessions using memory files in `.cursor/memory/`.

## Memory Files Structure

Create these files in `.cursor/memory/`:

- `project-overview.md` - High-level project description, tech stack, architecture
- `recent-changes.md` - Last 5 major changes, ongoing work, blockers
- `key-components.md` - Core modules, data flows, integration points
- `decisions.md` - Important architectural decisions and rationale

## Session Initialization

At the start of each chat:
1. Load all memory files from `.cursor/memory/`
2. Display project context summary
3. Note any gaps requiring updates

## Auto-Generation

If memory files don't exist:
1. Scan codebase for key patterns:
   - Read `README.md`, `package.json`, main entry files
   - Analyze folder structure and file naming
   - Identify main technologies and frameworks
2. Generate initial memory files with discovered context
3. Cross-link related concepts between files

## Maintenance Rules

- **Concise**: Each file under 200 lines, focus on facts not explanations
- **Cross-linked**: Reference related concepts with `[link](#file.md)`
- **Current**: Update after major changes or weekly reviews
- **Actionable**: Include concrete next steps and decisions needed

## Planning Integration

In planning mode, always include:
- "Review and update memory bank files"
- "Document new architectural decisions"
- "Update project overview with recent changes"

Example cross-linking:
```
Key API endpoints in [key-components.md](#key-components.md)
Recent auth changes in [recent-changes.md](#recent-changes.md)
```
